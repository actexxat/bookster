# ZBooks: A Simple Book Library App
## This app is developed as CS50x Final Project Submission

- ZBooks is a straightforward library application designed for book management, leveraging Google's Books API, Flask, and sqlite3. The app allows users to effortlessly organize their book collection by searching for books either by partial or full name. If the book data is available in Google's Books API, it is displayed on the results page.
The results page is optimized by limiting the displayed results to three, thereby reducing the time required to fetch data from the API. Additionally, users can access a "Profile" page where they have the flexibility to modify their username and email registered with the app.
After updating their book collection or making changes to their profile data, users can log out and return to the login page.
